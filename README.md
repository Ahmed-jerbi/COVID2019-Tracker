# COVID2019-Tracker
A simple Unity 2D Project tracking real-time numbers of Coronavirus-19 cases, deaths and recovered patients. 


This example focuses on Germany as part of the #WirBleibenZuhause campaign, but can be adjusted to any country listed by the Worldometer website. Just replace the URL in the *CoronaScraper.cs* script by "https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/[NameOfYourCountry]".
